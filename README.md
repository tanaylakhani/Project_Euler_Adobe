##Solutions for Project Euler Questions #182, #225, #429

To run the code:

```
python python_adobe_assignment.py
```

The above file is a wrapper to execute all the solutions together. You can run individual files to get the output of each problems.

## Reason for choosing the problems

All the problems I selected are based on number systems (Primes, GCD and Non-divisor) which I know better than the rest. As I had to work till Friday at the current job, I had limited time to familiarize myself with other chapters of mathematics. Though I had to read respective information from Wikipedia and MathWorld, it became relatively easy to understand, thus I chose these problems. However, since there were so many problems to choose from I also tried solving problem #230, #357, #377, #509 and #551 but found that I need little more time to solve those (partially solved). 

## Approach

Each problem contains comments to explain the approach used.
  
## References

Each problem file contains references used. Additional reading through Google Search, Wikipedia And MathWorld.

## Time Spent

Spent nearly one and half day on the exercise (Friday after-work through Saturday). Some of the time also utilized for partially solved problems mentioned above.
